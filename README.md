# Python scripts

### What is this repository all about?
It is a place where you can put some useful python scripts that you found helpful in your project work. Some examples of such scripts would be plotting a graph, removing whitespaces/commas/special characters/null values from your dataset, pre-processing images, or removing inconsistency from a dataset. And there are many practical examples that you must have come across while doing some exciting projects. If you have any such compelling script to share, please contribute to our repository. Your contribution is well appreciated.
